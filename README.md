## Abstract to Concrete Model Verification
<p align='justify'>This repository contains a Python tool for verifying and comparing abstract and concrete models represented in OWL files, commonly used in ontology-based modeling for various domains such as machine learning operations (MLOps). The tool automates the process of comparing nodes and properties between an abstract model and platform-specific concrete models, providing insights into the completeness and consistency of model representations across different platforms.</p>

## Features:
Node Verification: Automatically checks if all nodes in the abstract model are present in platform-specific concrete models.

Mapping Analysis: Generates CSV files to map abstract nodes to their corresponding nodes in platform-specific models.

Property Verification: Compares properties between abstract and concrete models to identify any missing or platform-specific properties.

Programmatic Verification: Provides programmatic verification of mappings and properties to ensure model consistency.

Modular Design: Organized into modular functions for easy integration into existing workflows or scripts.
